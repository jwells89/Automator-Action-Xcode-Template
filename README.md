# Automator-Action-Xcode-Template

This repo contains an updated version of the Automator Action template that used to ship with Xcode. Compared to the original it:

- Fixes the template to work with Xcode 14.3+
- Adds support for Swift
- Updates the template's icon to match the visual style of modern Xcode

For more on how it came to be and how to install and use the template, please take a look at [The Case of the Missing Xcode Template](https://wells.dev/the-case-of-the-missing-xcode-template/) and [Creating an Automator Action in 2023](https://wells.dev/creating-an-automator-action-in-2023/).
